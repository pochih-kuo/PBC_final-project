# My Life in NTU rpg
* The game is written purely in python, using the pygame library
* This is the final project of Programming for Business Computing (109-1).

## How to play
Players in this game will start as a freshman student eager to explore their college life.<br />
There are four levels to this game, each representing a challenge from each year in college. The result of each game will cause scores to be added or deducted from five aspects of life, which are: 👭freindship, 💪 health, ❤️ love life, 📚 gpa, and 💰 wealthiness. When a player finishes all levels of the game, the player graduates, and a title will be given at the end of the game in regards to the achievements reached throughout the game by evaluating scores in the five aspects.
